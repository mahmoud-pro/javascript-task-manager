# JavaScript Task Manager App

Welcome to the JavaScript Task Manager App! This is a simple web application that allows you to create tasks and store them in the client's local storage. Once a task is completed, you can easily delete it from the local storage. This app is built using JavaScript and utilizes the local storage API to manage tasks.

## Usage

### Creating a Task

To create a new task, follow these steps:

2. Press the "Add Task" button or hit Enter to add the task.

3. The task will be displayed in the task list below.

### Marking a Task as Completed

Once you have completed a task, you can mark it as done and remove it from the task list. Follow these steps:

1. Click on the checkbox next to the task you want to mark as completed.

2. The task will be crossed out to indicate that it has been completed.

3. The task will be automatically removed from the task list and deleted from local storage.

## Local Storage

The JavaScript Task Manager App uses the browser's local storage to store tasks. The local storage allows the app to persist data even if the page is refreshed or closed.


### Deleting Tasks

When a task is marked as completed, it is deleted from the local storage. This ensures that only active tasks are stored, and completed tasks do not clutter the storage.
